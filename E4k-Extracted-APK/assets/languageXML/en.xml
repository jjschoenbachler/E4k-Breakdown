Since the latest update to Android 5.0, many players have been reporting that they can't load different game apps, can't download updates, and are having problems in the in-game shop.
 
We are currently working closely with Google to find a solution to these problems as soon as possible. Until then, we recommend that you don't update your operating system.

In general, it's always a good idea to save your account so that problems with your device don't make you lose your progress in the game.

Keep these steps in mind for a successful attack:
- Spy on your target to see the formation of the enemy defenders.
- Counter the defense of enemy units. For example, the best way to defeat melee defenders such as spearmen is with ranged attackers. On the other hand, the best way to defeat bowmen is with melee attackers.
- Don't forget to use tools. The defender's walls and tools give them a strong combat bonus, but you can reduce it to 0% with the right tools!
- Pick the parts of the wall with the weakest defense. Attacking only the flanks can often give you a strategic advantage.
- Remember the combat bonus in the courtyard! All the soldiers you did not fight on the walls will be waiting for you outside the Keep.
- If you only breach one section of the wall, you lose 30% combat strength for the fight in the courtyard. If you breach two sections of the wall, the fight is balanced. If you breach all three parts of the wall, you earn a 30% bonus for the fight!"/>

Whenever this happens, stronger units take priority. However, no distinction is made between ranged and melee soldiers or attackers and defenders. For example, spearmen and bowmen count as equal, but the more valuable two-handed swordsman takes priority over both of them. The same rule also applies for weaker units who are already in the military hospital. They will automatically be discharged and then succumb to their wounds if more valuable soldiers need to be admitted.

Treat your wounded as fast as possible to prevent your doctors from having to discharge brave soldiers. As soon as the soldiers are in line for treatment, they no longer require space in the military hospital and therefore open up room for the wounded from the next battle. Wounded units in line for treatment are never discharged automatically: they don't leave until treatment is complete.

Lastly, don't forget to upgrade your military hospital! This lets you increase both how much space you have for the wounded and the number of slots available for soldiers in line for treatment."/>

- Don't give your password to anyone else. They could use it to log on to your account without your knowledge.

- Choose a password which is hard to guess to make it more difficult for someone else to access your account. For this reason, using your player name as your password is just as unadvisable as using &quot;123456&quot; or &quot;password&quot;.

- If you feel at any time that your password is not secure, you can easily change it. First tap on &quot;Settings&quot; at the top right of the screen. Then tap on &quot;Options&quot; and finally the silver key.

		<text id="treasuremap_1_copy" name="Once upon a time, Prince Percival was to be the new king of the land. But he was arrogant and unpopular with the people. He mocked his citizens and said they should crown a pig instead of him so they would then be ruled by one of their own kind.
To the little prince's great astonishment, the people took him at his word and soon afterwards, King Snout, the first of his name, was crowned the new king of the realm! He reigned over the people for six happy and peaceful years, and is still honored today in some circles as the greatest ruler of all time."/>

		<text id="treasuremap_2_copy" name="Once upon a time, Sir Bruno's life was spared when an arrow aimed at his heart landed and stuck in this noble knight's waving banner. On that day, Sir Bruno announced that he no longer needed to squeeze into a metal suit because his luck alone would protect him! He threw out his armor and rode into battle armed only with his lucky banner. He became famed throughout the land for his extraordinary courage. 
Even though a well-aimed crossbow bolt soon brought an abrupt end to his run of luck, his banner has ever since remained a symbol for the fine line between bravery and stupidity."/>

		<text id="treasuremap_3_copy" name="When the kingdom was first founded and wars plagued the land, King Richard I laid siege to Marktburg. When the moment finally came for the decisive assault on the castle, the good king took pity on the innocent citizens, and the women and children were allowed to leave the castle carrying whatever they could hold. 
But when the women filed out of the castle the next morning, they carried neither supplies nor treasured possessions: instead, they bore their husbands on their backs. King Richard laughed, and kept his royal promise. Thus the siege of Marktburg ended with no blood being shed."/>

		<text id="treasuremap_4_copy" name="Once a great king commissioned an artist to make him a valuable globe made from leather, gold, and jewels, and showing each of the three continents. The artist did as the king commanded, and filled the inside of the leather globe with water. Sadly, as it was being transported, the globe rolled off the coach and broke. The coachman, fearing punishment, decided to say nothing and deliver the globe in its new, flat shape. The king liked this flat earth so much that he quickly decreed that the whole kingdom should now see the world this way."/>

		<text id="treasuremap_5_title" name="The Brave Farmer"/>
		<text id="treasuremap_5_copy" name="Back in the day, chivalrous tournaments always featured a farmer made to fight for the amusement of the king and nobles. The chosen farmer would be dressed up in armor and then given a thorough beating. At one tournament, however, a farmer named Ruppich could not be subdued. He slashed about so wildly that even the most renowned knights in the kingdom took to their heels. The king was impressed and asked to see this simple man. &quot;What is the secret of your fighting, good man?&quot; he asked. &quot;My king,&quot; the farmer answered, &quot;the secret of my fighting is a wasp under my armor.&quot;"/>
		<text id="treasuremap_6_title" name="Help in Need"/>
		<text id="treasuremap_6_copy" name="Felix, the famous bandit captain, once came upon a farm where he saw a farmer's wife crying bitterly. &quot;What grieves you so, milady?&quot; he asked. Sobbing, she replied, &quot;I cannot pay my taxes, and the Count will soon be here to take away my farm!&quot; Felix slipped a pouch of gold into the woman's hands and vanished. The Count was shocked that the farmer's wife could now pay and the farm would remain hers! He left in a fury. His wrath only increased further when he was ambushed by bandits on his way home. And that's how the farmer's wife kept her farm and the bandit kept his gold!"/>

		<text id="treasuremap_8_copy" name="Once upon a time, a hunter named Yolo tried to catch a snow panther. To entice the beast, he disguised himself as a glacier hen, but when he imitated the bird's mating call, a love-struck rooster appeared and tried to force itself on him. The bird's advances were so insistent that Yolo was forced to flee. As he ran he collided with a snow panther, who would have promptly devoured him but for the rooster, who came to Yolo's rescue and pecked the panther into submission with its sharp beak. And thus began the story of Yolo and his loyal battle rooster Ono, who went on to have many an exciting adventure together."/>
		<text id="treasuremap_9_title" name="Deep Freeze"/>
		<text id="treasuremap_9_copy" name="A group of villagers hiking over a glacier once found a man frozen in a crevice who seemed to have been there for many years. They carved him out of the ice and took him to their village, where he slowly thawed out. The man turned out to be a bard, and he sang them a song in gratitude. At first the villagers were flattered, but then the bard did not stop singing! For days he crooned one song after another. Eventually they became so tired of his voice that they threw him back into the crevice. To this day he is still there, waiting for someone to free him so he can finally sing again."/>

		<text id="treasuremap_10_copy" name="Once upon a time, a group of adventurers set out to find the legendary scorpion amulet. After weeks of searching, they discovered it in an abandoned temple. But when they picked it up, a horde of scorpions swarmed out of the ground and attacked them. Only one man made it out alive. Suddenly he came face to face with a band of robbers who had been waiting for him! It seemed like the man's sorry fate was sealed, yet as he clutched the amulet close to his chest, he saw the sand beneath his enemies' feet transform into millions of poisonous scorpions. The robbers had no chance. This lonely warrior was known from that day on as the King of the Scorpions."/>

We have stepped up our campaign against the use of 3rd party software, otherwise known as bots or mods. The use of these programs by a small number of players has already had an adverse effect on performance and player experience. To combat this issue, we will be introducing new features that will eliminate most of the functions that these programs are being used for, and have outlined a punishment system for users that continue to use these bots. 

We will now begin using our very own detection software to identify players using bots, and issue an initial 1 hour ban to all flagged accounts. Continued use will subject your account to escalating punishment, ending in a permanent ban. In addition we have taken legal action against the creators of these programs, and will continue to do so. You can find additional information in the Royal Post or the Empire: Four Kingdoms forum."/>

Each server's success will be determined by the total number of points earned by its castle lords during each event, so gather your armies and prepare for battle!

		<text id="help_shapeshifter" name="The attack of the shapeshifters is a time limited event in which you can anonymously fight and compete against other castle lords on the world map. At the start of the event, shapeshifter totems will appear in front of your castle in the Great Empire. Each totem represents a real player on the world map and will imitate that player's actions. 

New totems will appear outside your castle each day during the event, but you can only attack each totem once!

Each attack on a shapeshifter totem will cost you one attack rune. Each castle lord is granted five free attack runes each day, while a maximum of five additional runes can be purchased daily. Additional attack runes can only be purchased once you have used all your current runes.

Important: Attack runes must be used on the same day on which they were purchased or they will be lost with the daily event reset.

When attacking shapeshifter totems, you will only lose tools that have been used during the attack, while all your troops will return to your castle without any loss, even in defeat. Troops will be lost when attacking in hardcore mode, however, the rewards for these attacks will be greater. Beware: The shapeshifters are a cunning bunch and often hide information about themselves in battle reports. 

Attacking shapeshifter totems will earn you shapeshifter charms and event points depending how well you plan and execute your attacks. Once you've collected points on five different occassions, you will complete a point series. The highest point series you achieve during the event will be saved and used in the event rankings. Your ranking position will earn you shapeshifter insignias, which can be spent in the event shop. 

You can increase the number of points each attack earns by purchasing point boosters from the event shop. Please note that these point boosters can only be used during certain shapeshifter events.

Enemies can also launch attacks on your castle, but there's no need to worry, since you won't sustain any damage to your buildings or units. However, it is always worth keeping your defenses strong to reduce the amount of event points your enemy attackers receive. You can access a special shapeshifter view in your defense overview to help you get a better picture of your defenses against shapeshifter attacks.

The attack of the shapeshifters is a single player event, so you are unable to call upon your alliance for assistance, though you can always turn to them for advice on how to best defend your castle."/>

Players can help guide their server to victory by actively participating in a variety of tasks such as defeating invading armies, battling against other castle lords, and overpowering villainous robber barons. 

After each round, the servers with the most victorious level brackets will earn 3 ranking points, while defeated servers will earn 0. Points At the end of the event rewards will be distributed to servers according to their final ranking. Special rewards for certain top performing alliances are also up for grabs, so grab your swords and get ready for battle!

To begin the fusion process, you must first select the decoration you want to level up. This is called the fusion target. All decorations with a target icon can be selected as a fusion target. 

Next, select a second decoration you want to use for the fusion process. This is called the fusion source. All decorations with a source icon that are stored in the buildings storehouse can be selected as a fusion source. 

Finally, select a catalyst. 

Note: Fusion sources and catalysts are consumed during the fusion process.

In addition to standard fusions, the decoration fusion forge also offers the option of premium fusions that provide a 100% boost on the bonus fusion XP. The fusion energy cost of standard and premium fusions is the same and determined by the selected fusion target. However, while standard fusions cost fusion coins and kingdom resources, premium fusions only cost rubies. 

Kingdom resources are deducted from the stock in the main castle of the Great Empire.

Once a decoration has been fused for the first time it is classed as unique and will be marked with a special icon. Unique decorations are not stackable and require their own capacity slot when stored in the buildings storehouse. If a non-unique decoration is stored in the buildings storehouse and there is no capacity space left for unique decorations, you cannot level it up until you place it in one of your castles."/>

That amount of fusion XP includes a modifier based on the relation of the target's and source's fusion levels. While a source with a higher fusion level than the target will increase the modifier, the reverse will decrease it.

The selected fusion source also determines the bonus fusion XP chance. Similar to the fusion XP, the bonus fusion XP chance is subject to the same source to target fusion level relation modifier. The bonus fusion XP chances can be further increased by the selected catalyst. If the selected catalyst tier is higher than the minimum required catalyst tier for the fusion level of the selected fusion target, then the catalyst will grant an additional bonus fusion XP chance.

The bonus fusion XP chance increases the likelihood of earning additional bonus fusion XP. Bonus fusion XP is determined by the level of the decoration fusion forge and the fusion level of the target. The bonus fusion XP chance can exceed 100%, with any percent above providing a boost to the bonus fusion XP.

Fusion XP and potential bonus fusion XP are added to the current XP value of the selected fusion target. If enough fusion XP is gained then the fusion level of the selected fusion target increases."/>

		<text id="dialog_info_message_description_156" name="We have received a lot of questions regarding the new temporary server event in recent weeks and would like to take this opportunity to address the three most discussed issues. 

- Why do players have to start at level 1?
For this first run of the Outer Realms event, we wanted to gauge initial player reactions before deciding where to take the event in the future. Therefore, we decided to use the simplest technical implementations rather than spend many months of production on an event that may be poorly received. It is for this reason that all players start at level 1. 

If the event is a success in terms of player enjoyment and participation, we will look into the possibility of implementing more complex features including different starting levels during future events. 

- Why are some servers excluded from the event?
Again, this decision was made due to technical limitations, specifically those that relate to displaying localized text within the new temporary server. Although it was our initial intention to make the event available to all players, we found that the user interface struggled to properly display certain languages resulting in a poor user experience. 

- Why do we focus on PvP?
We based many of the elements featured in the new event on feedback we have received from our community. As many players regularly request more PvP events in the game, we decided to place the main focus of the Outer Realms event on PvP."/>

The Kingdom's League consists of three major components:

- Division rankings, in which you compete against a limited number of players based on points earned from league events.
- Kingdom titles, which determine the rewards you will receive during the event and your final season ranking.
- Season rankings, which measure the progress each player has made during the entire Kingdom's League season. 

Detailed information regarding each of these components can be found in the league guide.

All players above level 10 can take part in the Kingdom's League. Participation is automatic and comes at no cost. 

Each season of the Kingdom's League lasts for a pre-determined number of event days. Each day a league event is active, a day is deducted from the league’s season runtime. 

Please note that the Kingdom's League is completely independent from King Ludwig’s seasonal contests."/>

- Nomad Invasion
- Samurai Invasion
- War of the Realms
- Bloodcrow Invasion
- Battle of Berimond

If two of these events are active at the same time, only one of them will provide points for the Kingdom's League.

The event providing points contains a button in its event overview that directly links to the Kingdom's League overview. 

A season of the Kingdom's League can include several events of the same type, but a new round of matchmaking for the division rankings will take place for each individual event."/>

For each of the events, you will receive a medal according to your current position in the division ranking. The higher your position, the better the medal. You can find details regarding medals in the medal overview.

You can only be promoted to a higher reputation, you will never get demoted to a lower title.

There are two types of rewards connected to each reputation title:

- Promotion rewards: Awarded once you earn a new reputation title

		<text id="help_tempServer" name="The Outer Realms is a special event that allows castle lords to compete for unique rewards with players from around the world on a temporary event server. 

When playing the Outer Realms event, you will be taken to a temporary event server in which you can build a new castle and collect daily ranking points in a bid to win valuable rewards. 

How you collect the daily ranking points changes with each edition of the event, so be sure to check out the &quot;scoring overview&quot; at the start of each event. 

The daily ranking points you collect are added to your overall score, which will be used to determine the final rankings and rewards at the end of the event. Participation rewards will also be granted based on the ranking points you collect during the event. 

When first entering a new Outer Realms event, you can choose a castle you would like to start the event with. The castle you choose will determine the quality and quantity of your starting buildings and resources. 

The Outer Realms also offer specific daily duties that will reward the player with daily duty points. These points will unlock additional rewards at the end of the Outer Realms event for the player's main server account.

During the event, players can form alliances and trade with other castle lords within the event server. These alliances are completely separate from the alliances in each player's main server. 

It is not possible to transfer troops, resources, currencies or subscription and VIP bonuses from main server castles to event castle, and vice versa. It is, however, possible to purchase rubies and activate VIP bonuses inside the temporary server. 

At the end of the Outer Realms event all buildings and resources will disappear, though all event rewards and unspent rubies purchased inside the event server will be transferred to each player's main server account within 10 days. Player's will only receive the reward of their specific rank, and not the rewards from each of the lower ranks."/>

During the event, players can launch special attacks that will allow them to loot essences from their enemies. The amount of essences that can be claimed during each attack can be increased by equipping commanders with special equipment items or by using special essence boosters, all of which can be purchased from the event shop with rubies.

At the start of the event, players will receive a supply of essences as well as one special equipment item. Player's will also receive additional essences each day of the event according to the amount of essences already in their possesion.

There's no need to fear the vengeance of your enemies during the event, as all attacks are anonymous. Additionally, attackers and defenders won't lose any tools, troops or resources from battles, nor will their buildings suffer any fire damage.

The amount of essences you still have in your possesion at the end of the event will determine the rewards you receive - so keep your defences strong to prevent your essences being claimed by your enemies!

Please note that any excess essences you have in your possession after the event has ended will be lost."/>

The Kingdom's League consists of three major components:

- Division rankings, in which you compete against a limited number of players based on points earned from league events.
- Kingdom titles, which determine the rewards you will receive during the event and your final season ranking.
- Season rankings, which measure the progress each player has made during the entire Kingdom's League season. 

Detailed information regarding each of these components can be found in the league guide.

All players above level {0} can take part in the Kingdom's League. Participation is automatic and comes at no cost. 

Each season of the Kingdom's League lasts for a pre-determined number of event days. Each day a league event is active, a day is deducted from the league’s season runtime. 

Please note that the Kingdom's League is completely independent from King Ludwig’s seasonal contests."/>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/5fgXoJH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&amp;percnt;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; and as such there might be some bugs that we need to iron out still. However we do hope that you will test this event for us and help us improve the event for the future. To that end we would like to let you know a few details about how the event works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to be level 30 and a member of an Alliance before the event starts if you want to take part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you start you will be assigned to a new Alliance composed of the other members from your main account Alliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These new Alliances are restricted to twenty members and the first to join will be the Leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need to attack City States on the map to gain Influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Influence is what your alliance needs to win the event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every day the Influence you have gained will be transferred to the vaults in the Alliance Capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rivals will be able to attack you or the Alliance Capital to steal a portion of the accumulated Influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You and your Alliance members will have to focus on both attack and defence and only by organising well will you be able to compete and win this event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy our new event!&lt;/p&gt;"/>

When playing the Outer Realms event, you will be taken to a temporary event server in which you can build a new castle and collect points in a bid to win valuable rewards. 

When first entering the Outer Realms, you can choose a castle you would like to start the event with. The castle you choose will determine the quality and quantity of your starting buildings and resources. 

The Outer Realms also offers daily duties, the completion of which will earn you daily duty points. These points will unlock additional rewards that can be used in your main castle at the end of the event.

During the event, you can form alliances and trade with other castle lords within the event server. These alliances are completely separate from the alliances in your main server. 

It is not possible to transfer troops, resources, currencies or subscription and VIP bonuses from your main server castles to event castle, and vice versa. It is, however, possible to purchase rubies and activate VIP bonuses inside the temporary server. 

At the end of the Outer Realms event, all buildings and resources will disappear, though all event rewards and unspent rubies purchased inside the event server will be transferred to your main server account within 10 days.

In the War of the Toucan Gods event, your alliance is tasked with collecting statuettes by defeating jungle shrines connected to your enemies. 

Once per day, all the statuettes collected by the individual members of each alliance are added up to determine the alliance's event ranking.

During the event, up to five members of each alliance are connected to a jungle shrine and tasked with defending it against enemy attacks. The number of statuettes that can be looted from each shrine is increased by breaching castles that are connected to it. The more castles you breach, the more statuettes you will earn. Breached castles are refortified every few hours. 

The number of statuettes contained within each shrine also increases with a shrine's level, which increases once the players connected to it have attacked a predefined number of enemy shrines. 

All alliance members can support the defense of a jungle shrine. The defense setup for every shrine is predefined, and only a limited number of troops can be stationed there. Each alliance member can also upgrade effects and activate boosts to improve the defenses of shrines belonging to their alliance.

Every shrine your alliance fails to successfully defend will increase your alliance's statuette penalty, which decreases the amount of statuettes that are counted towards your alliance's ranking points each day - so be sure to keep your defences up!

Every two event days, all alliance members are reassigned to defend another jungle shrine belonging to your alliance."/>

Food and honey are automatically taken from the castle's storage to produce mead. To ensure that your castle does not run out of critical resources, use the stock limit slider to set a production limit. Once this limit has been reached, the mead production will stop.
You can also decide whether food consumption priority is given to the brewery. If you activate that option, food from the castle's storage will be used first to maintain mead production, before being used to supply food-consuming troops.

Remember to use the save changes button to save any changes you made to the brewery settings.

		<text id="help_legendTemple" name="The Hall of Legends allows you to unlock powerful legendary skills for both attacking and defending. To do this, you'll need legendary points, which are earnt by upgrading your Hall of Legends. Your legendary level determines the highest upgrade level available to you.

Legendary skills are divided into several levels, but only the lowest will be available to you in the beginning. Once you've allocated a certain number of legendary points to one level, the next level will be automatically unlocked for you. Furthermore, after levels two and five, powerful master skills will be activated for free.

You also have the option to reset all of your legendary skills and redistribute your points. You will not lose any points by doing this, and the upgrade level of your Hall of Legends won't change. The first reset of a reset period is free, but each consecutive reset will cost rubies. The rubies required increases with each reset. After a set amount of days has passed the fee is reset to zero.

Most legendary skills are only effective against castle lords with a legendary level. However, they are always effective against centers of command even if the owner of the center of command has not yet achieved legendary status.

The Hall of Legends also provides access to new forms of power the sovereign system. By collecting sceats from various events you can unlock powerful buildings and units. Those upgrades are not connected to your Hall of Legends level, but directly to your legendary level and can be used against any type of enemy. 

You must progress through all the tier levels of an upgrade to unlock the following one. You also have to upgrade the keep in your main castle of the Great Empire to unlock additional tiers. Upgrading keeps in outposts or other castles does NOT unlock sovereign skill tiers. Some skills also have additional requirements, such having certain buildings on a defined level in your main castle. All conditions for unlocking a skill have to be met in the main castle, NOT in outposts or castles in other kingdoms!

Unlike the legendary skill system, you will not be able to reset your points in the sovereign system."/>

When playing the Outer Realms event, you will be taken to a temporary event server in which you can build a new castle and collect daily ranking points in a bid to win valuable rewards. 

How you collect the daily ranking points changes with each edition of the event, so be sure to check out the &quot;scoring overview&quot; at the start of each event. 

The daily ranking points you collect are added to your overall score, which will be used to determine the final rankings and rewards at the end of the event. Participation rewards will also be granted based on the ranking points you collect during the event. 

In the current outer realms event, you can enter the event with a copy of your main castle. This copy will contain all buildings and decorations, but not troops, tools, resources, or currencies. 

During the event, players can form alliances and trade with other castle lords within the event server. These alliances are completely separate from the alliances in each player's main server. 

It is not possible to transfer troops, resources, currencies or subscription and VIP bonuses from main server castles to event castle, and vice versa. It is, however, possible to purchase rubies and activate VIP bonuses inside the temporary server. 

At the end of the Outer Realms event all buildings and resources will disappear, though all event rewards and unspent rubies purchased inside the event server will be transferred to each player's main server account within 10 days. Player's will only receive the reward of their specific rank, and not the rewards from each of the lower ranks."/>

During the event, players can launch special attacks that will allow them to loot pelts from their enemies. The amount of pelts that can be claimed during each attack can be increased by equipping commanders with special equipment items, or by using special hunting boosters, all of which can be purchased with rubies from the event shop.

At the start of the event, players will receive a supply of pelts as well as one special equipment item. Players will also receive additional pelts each day of the event according to the amount of pelts already in their possession. 

There's no need to fear the vengeance of your enemies during the event, as all attacks are anonymous. Additionally, attackers and defenders won't lose any tools, troops or resources from battles, nor will their buildings suffer any fire damage.

During the event, players can launch special attacks that will allow them to loot party balloons from their enemies. The amount of balloons that can be claimed during each attack can be increased by equipping commanders with special equipment items, or by using special balloon boosters, all of which can be purchased with rubies from the event shop.

At the start of the event, players will receive a supply of party balloons as well as one special equipment item. Player's will also receive additional party balloons each day of the event according to the amount of balloons already in their possession. 

There's no need to fear the vengeance of your enemies during the party as all attacks are anonymous. Additionally, attackers and defenders won't lose any tools, troops or resources from battles, nor will their buildings suffer any fire damage.

The amount of party balloons you still have in your possession at the end of the event will determine the rewards you receive - so keep your defences strong to prevent your balloons being claimed by your enemies!

Please note that any excess party balloons you have in your possession after the event has ended will be lost."/>

Each patron requires a specific offering to introduce you to the generals. There are also time-limited special offerings that can be given to Princess Beatrice; these special offerings can be used to gain shards for the most recent general added to the game.
In regular time intervals you can also interact with the patrons for free, requiring no offerings.

Each time you interact with the patrons you participate in a tombola draw. Each draw grants you four rewards. The greatest rewards of all are the generals shards. These valuable tokens can be used to unlock generals, as well as improve their star rating. Go to the generals' overview to use these shards to recruit new generals and boost your own generals.

“It’s the circle of life that keeps us alive, not what big leaders say. Trust your gut and your surroundings more than mere words.”

During uncertain times, even the noblest ruler requires people with special talents to accomplish tasks unsuitable for knights or warriors. When stealth and discretion are required, the noble lords of the Empire can turn to Leo and his loyal falcon Ayala.

A true son of the forest, Leo is a hunter and gatherer of food and intelligence. Leo trusts his instincts more than any person. His skills don't stop there though! Leo is also a master of close range weapons, especially a dagger. Rumor even has it, that the dagger he owns was a gift from the Emperor for a successful hunt.

Few details are known about Leo's early life, but he has been known to tell stories over a tankard of ale, of how he earned his skills in the great cool rain forests of the western coast lands. Among the giant trees, Leo learned how to watch his prey while remaining unseen, how to stalk and track and hunt beasts big and small, and how to read the land, the sky, and the behavior of animals and humans alike. Few things escape his keen gaze, and for anything hidden from his view, his faithful feathered friend is willing to provide aerial support.

Leo has wandered through all the lands of the continent, selling his skills to those in need. Yet he follows his own personal code of honor, and would never take a task that would make the weak and powerless suffer. Leo likes to keep a low profile and avoids getting too caught up in the politics of the Great Empire. Instead he focuses on honest trade, those people dear to him, and being at one with nature."/>
		<text id="generals_characters_103_narrative" name="Rebel Pirate Alyssa

“Don’t tell me your life story! Tell me for how much gold you’d sell your boots, and I’ll know everything there is to know about you!”

There are many words you could use to describe Alyssa. Adventurous, courageous, ruthless, greedy … but the most suitable word would be &quot;clever&quot; … maybe sometimes even too clever for her own good.

A daughter of the mighty Storm Islands warriors, she was given the birth name Atami, which means &quot;clever&quot; in their native language. 
Even at a young age, it was clear the girl was born to sail the length of the seventeen seas on the ocean breeze. Reading the wind and the sky when the sun was high, and at night she knew every star.

Young Atami was cunning and always out for a profit. Trading with - and occasionally cheating - the locals, she found her calling when the first traders and adventurers from the Great Empire arrived on the Storm Islands. 
One of those foreigners was the nefarious pirate king known as Redbeard. Sensing a fool who needed to part with his possessions, Atami signed up as a crew member and local guide for Redbeard. Under her guidance, Redbeard pirates plundered trade ships throughout the Storm Islands.  
Of course, Atami’s supposed loyalty to Redbeard was just an elaborate ploy, and she was waiting for the right moment to rob him blind.  Exploiting his greed for precious aquamarine, she lured Redbeard and his most loyal crew to a deserted atoll. Atami and her followers quickly took control of Redbeard’s flagship, set sail, and left the raging pirate king behind. 
Knowing that Redbeard would eventually be rescued by other ships in his fleet, Atami decided to sail to friendlier waters and took on the name Alyssa. This name would soon become infamous across the seventeen seas.
Over the following years, Alyssa and her Stormcloud pirates would sail, trade, fight and feast all over the world, from the Sunrise Realm to the rainy shores of Berimond. Her navigation skills got the crew through every storm. Her merciless blade and sharp wit saw the Stormcloud pirates beat every foe who stood against them. And Alyssa’s sense of profit brought them lots of lucrative trade deals and mercenary work. Their ship's hold filled up with loot and wealth, and Alyssa’s love of treasure would become legendary at every port and island. 
Yet Alyssa followed her own code of honor, showing mercy to defeated foes, never taking from the poor, and helping sailors in need who were at the mercy of the ocean. 

Years later, Alyssa and her crew arrived in the Tangled Wilderness. Seeking treasure in the jungle, she and her crew instead stumbled upon Leo the Wildland Hunter. While the plucky pirate and the stoic ranger made quite the contrast, they got along surprisingly well. Leo insisted that he was not lost, but merely needed a passage back to the Empire. Alyssa was happy to give her new friend a hand and to have a new victim to play dice games with. Her crew knew better than to gamble with Alyssa.

Back in the Empire, Leo introduced her to some of his contacts among the nobility. Alyssa now offers her services to those who need it … for a generous compensation, of course."/>
		<text id="generals_characters_101_narrative" name="Dragon Cultist Toril, the Lone Lancer

“My name? They call me Toril. I lost part of my name way back when my old self was killed... No, it’s not Victoria.”

A deadly warrior raised by her parents in the arts of the dragon cult, with the goal of making Toril the next Lady of the Flames. The inhuman training and dark nature of the dragon cult scarred her body and mind, but also made her a master of the glaive, an unrivaled dragon rider, and awoke a strategic mindset and unyielding bravery within her. But most importantly, and despite all the hardship, she never lost her heart. 

Toril's skills always ensured her victory in every battle against the enemies of the dragon cult, fighting side by side with her cousin Yigris. But the true dangers came from her fellow cultists: rivalries, murder, backstabbing. Blades in the night, quick hands wielding poison, accusations, lies, and betrayal, and worst of all ... dark, forbidden magic. 
Finally fed up with the cruelty and cutthroat nature of her home, Toril decided to gain her freedom. Planning her escape from the dragon cult's lair, she decided to take her beloved cousin Yigris along. But when the day of their escape came, Yigris, in an act of ultimate betrayal, stabbed Toril in the back with a poisonous blade! Despite the terrible wound, Toril was able to fight off Yigris and made her escape from the Fire Peaks. Yigris meanwhile, having gotten rid of her greatest rival and hated cousin, soon assumed the mantle of Lady of the Flames.

Despite her wounds, Toril made her way to the Great Empire, where she recovered and entered the service of the Emperor.  Due to her wounds and cousin's betrayal, she is now covered from head to toe in the Empire’s royal armor.

She once fought alongside Veteran General Lord Horatio to reach a common goal, protecting the weak from being overpowered by the strong. And ever since, she has been known to have a lance of steel but a heart of gold in the Great Empire."/>
		<text id="generals_characters_104_narrative" name="Veteran General Lord Horatio Bannington

“I might have seen much in my lifetime, but there is just as much that I have yet to lay my eyes upon.”

What can be said about Horatio Bannington ... a man whose deeds have made him a living legend among the people of the Great Empire?

One might listen to the stories of how Horatio is the most decorated general across all kingdoms, the leader of countless battles? Or perhaps talk about his legendary campaign against the diabolical robber king, Wolfgard the Flayer?  Or maybe let the bards sing about young Horatio's earliest accomplishments, when he was a loyal companion to the great Emperor during his days as an adventurous prince? Songs of adventure and great deeds, and about how the two supposedly left a trail of broken hearts behind them in every town and village...

As always, the truth is less colorful than the tales. Horatio is a loyal vassal and personal friend of the Emperor. A bulwark of strength insurmountable for most enemies of the Empire. 
His skill with the shield is rivaled by none, his blade swift and just, and his leadership and strategic skills are legendary. For decades, Horatio has fought in many successful battles, several of them alongside the greatest warriors and generals of the Empire, such as his brother in arms King Eric, Toril the Lone Lancer, and many more. 

In later years, Horatio's heart was drawn to the north of the Empire, where he now commands his own bastion. By his word and blade, the northern marches have experienced an era of peace and prosperity.

He is known across the continent not just as a talented fighter, but also for the extravagant feasts he loves to celebrate!

There are two things in life that Horatio cannot stand: a bad bard playing terrible music during one of his feasts, and Wolfgard the Flayer."/>

&quot;A masterless blade
Like a sakura in wind
Will wander the world.”
 
Far to the east, at the edges of the known world, lie the Sunrise Kingdoms. Few travelers from the Great Empire have made the journey to those realms, but those who return tell tall tales of an exotic land of a thousand islands. Eternally blooming cherry trees, tall towering mountains crowned by mighty castles, and a people whose very heart and soul is rooted in the philosophy of Bushido, the way of the Samurai warrior.  
 
Sasaki has been walking the path of the warrior since her earliest childhood. In the Sunrise Kingdoms, a child is presented with three items on their third birthday: a tool, a coin, and a blade. Which item the child chooses will guide its destiny. On that day, under the blooming Sakura trees, young Sasaki chose the blade without a hint of hesitation. Consequently, she was soon sent to the castle of Shôgun Takemura to begin her training as a samurai. Takemura and his warriors taught Sasaki the art of the blade and the ways of the warrior, and thus the young woman soon became a master of the Katana. Likewise, her mind was sharpened by the lessons and cunning of Takemura’s aunt, the honorable Obâ-san.
 
Mastery of weapons and warfare, martial arts, valor in battle, honor, and especially loyalty … the essence of the warrior, tenets that would sound familiar and aspirational to any knight from the Great Empire. Yet, like so often in life … under the wrong circumstances, noble ideas can be twisted into something sinister … into a tool of infamy and malice.
 
A blade that is not drawn becomes dull. A tool forgotten in a shed will start to rust. And rules of honor and courtesy turn into shackles when they no longer have meaning. What is the purpose of a warrior when the realm knows peace, of a blade that is never drawn from its sheath? The sunrise kingdoms had known internal peace for a long time … too long a time for some Samurai. If honor could not be gained at home, the warriors of Bushido would find it abroad. This ushered in the start of the dreaded Samurai Invasions.
 
Led by the nefarious Shogun Akechi, armies of fanatical samurai made for the lands upon the shores of the Stormy Ocean. Sasaki, who had entered Akechi’s service after completing her training, took part in many battles. She fought in the bloody conquest of the Spice Islands. Skirmished in the tangled Wilderness where she faced off against both the natives and Wildland Hunter Leo.  She even crossed blades with Alyssa, when the rebel pirate’s fleet ambushed Akechi’s invasion force in the Storm Islands.
But with each battle fought, with each foe slain, each stronghold plundered and burned to the ground, Sasaki’s heart grew heavier. She wondered what the purpose of all the bloodshed could possibly be. The samurai were not fighting to protect their homes and hearths. They had traveled to foreign shores to fight people who had never held any ill intention towards the Sunrise Kingdoms. With horror, Sasaki began to realize that too many of her fellow warriors had forgotten the core tenets of Bushido. Striving for martial prowess and gaining honor in battle had become motives of their own, and were no longer a noble tool used to protect the weak and defenseless. And she herself had stained her blade and her honor with the blood of the innocent.
 
When Akechi launched his infamous invasion of the Great Empire, Sasaki knew she had to act and challenged the rogue Shogun to a duel of honor. Akechi’s strikes were cruel and strong as a winter storm, but speed and swordsmanship were with Sasaki, and with a single swift strike, she shattered Akechi’s blade! But before she could strike down the mad warlord, his henchmen set upon Sasaki with bows and lances, turning a duel of honor into a farce! Outnumbered but not outfought, Sasaki broke through the enemy ranks and made her escape, first from Akechi’s castle and then from the Sunrise Kingdoms!
 
Arriving in the Great Empire, Sasaki vowed that she would never dishonor her blade again, nor follow any false lord. Taking up the mantle of a Ronin, a masterless samurai, she would from now on fight to protect those wronged by her former countrymen.
For the time being, she will stay in the Great Empire and offer her services to the lords and ladies of the realm. The customs of the land might be strange, the food not to her liking, and Lord Horatio’s feasts too rowdy … but the battles will be glorious and just. Sasaki knows that she will finally be able to follow the true way of Bushido."/>

		<text id="generals_characters_117_narrative" name="&quot;Where the weak cower, the strong take. I am the strongest.&quot;
 
North of the Great Empire, where the biting winds of the Everwinter Glacier howl through frozen fjords and icy mountains, rules a king as harsh and unyielding as the land he commands: Olafsson the Barbarian King.
 
A boisterous bruiser and a warlord of unyielding cruelty, Olafson’s philosophy is simple: the strength of one's arm and the edge of one's blade determine one's worth. With a booming laugh that rings across the icy tundra, he leads his Northmen in thunderous charges and lightning-quick raids. His axe, a fearsome weapon as cold and merciless as the northern winds, has cleaved many a foe in two. The villages in his territory bear the brunt of his harsh rule, reduced to destitution under his oppressive regime.
 
However, not all northmen bow to Olafsson. Warriors such as Barin reject his reign, standing tall against his tyranny. Barin, considering himself the true embodiment of northman strength, refuses to bow to Olafsson and his rule. This conflict within the northmen ranks further fuels the fires of Olafsson's wrath, his icy glare forever fixed on his defiant subjects.
 
Olafsson's foes are not confined to his frost-bitten realm. On the high seas, his longships clash with the pirate fleet led by the elusive Alyssa, the fierce naval battles lighting up the frosty northern seas. In the snowy wilderness, Olafsson must also contend with Leo the Hunter, a master of guile and sabotage, who has thwarted Olafsson's campaigns time and again.
 
His greatest adversary, however, lies at the heart of the Great Empire. Veteran General Lord Horatio, the stalwart protector of the Empire's northern marches, has repeatedly rebuffed Olafsson's attempts to raid the Empire. Their bitter enmity is as relentless as the frost, their conflicts echoing in the winds that sweep across the icy tundra.
Yet, in the unforgiving cold of the Everwinter Glacier, Olafsson remains undeterred. His axe, as biting and cruel as the winter winds, is always ready to carve a path through friend and foe alike. After all, in the harsh north, only the strong can truly rule."/>

		<text id="generals_characters_116_summary" name="Despot of the Burning Sands"/>
		<text id="generals_characters_116_narrative" name="&quot;Every grain of sand in this desert knows my name. Soon, you will too.&quot;
 
In the sun-drenched kingdom of the Burning Sands, beyond the Great Empire's southern border, one man rules with an iron fist and a heart as cold as the desert night. That man is Sultan al-Killah.
 
This cruel and vain sultan holds the Burning Sands in a tight grip of fear. He takes what he desires without hesitation, his greed only matched by his arrogance. The jewel of his eye, his treasured emerald collection, is a glaring testament to his vanity. But for a long time, a most precious gem has eluded his collection: the fair Princess Fiorella, a maiden from the Great Empire.
 
As an adversary, Sultan al-Killah is not a foe to be underestimated. A skilled tactician, he thrives on cunning strategies, employing hidden traps, deceptive ambushes, and the treacherous terrain of the desert to confound and weaken his enemies. The towers and fortresses under his rule are formidable, their sturdy walls reflecting his unyielding determination. Meanwhile, his forces, ruthless desert warriors, are as unpredictable as a sandstorm, launching sudden and devastating assaults.
 
The sultan's refusal to bow before any emperor speaks volumes about his audacious nature. He views the authority of the Emperor as nothing more than a fading mirage in his desert kingdom. The independent trading cities of the Burning Sands, under the Emperor’s protection and refusing to submit to the sultan’s reign, are a thorn in al-Killah's side, fueling his disdain and ire. Yet, his ambitions towards the free cities are constantly thwarted by a formidable adversary: Hassan the Engineer, a loyal servant of the Empire. The architect behind many of the defenses protecting the free desert cities, Hassan's architectural brilliance is a constant hindrance to Sultan al-Killah's ambitions.
 
In the scorching heat of the Burning Sands, a daunting adversary awaits. To cross swords with him is to court death, but then again, isn't that what makes the game of power all the more thrilling? For in the desert, as the sultan himself knows too well, even the smallest grain of sand can tip the scale of fate."/>

		<text id="generals_characters_106_narrative" name="&quot;Every fortress has a weakness. Every defense a crack. The wolf waits and watches, and then strikes without mercy.&quot;

Years ago, he was just a whisper, a cautionary tale from the Great Empire's turbulent past. Wolfgard the Flayer: a cruel and cunning man, a traitor who once stood among the highest-ranking generals of the Empire, only to turn his back on his duty for the sake of ruthless ambition.

Wolfgard's eyes gleam with an unnerving, predatory intelligence. His wolf-like grin and sharp features are a chilling testament to his brutal nature. With a broadsword in one hand and a dagger in the other, he strikes with a ferocity that has earned him his fearsome moniker.

In the Empire's bygone days, Wolfgard was a scourge that spread fear throughout the land. His brutalities were infamous, as was his cadre of bandits and villains. The Weasel, his loyal henchman, and others like him razed villages, spread chaos across the green lands of the Empire, and even kidnapped noble maidens. But Wolfgard's ambition led to his downfall: after a defiant stand against his tyranny, his forces were scattered, and Wolfgard was exiled from the Empire he sought to bring down.

But nightmares do not die; they simply lay low between dawn and dusk… From the depths of his exile at the fringes of the Empire, Wolfgard watched and waited, plotting his return. Gathering a motley army of bandits and disloyal soldiers, the nefarious warlord prepared to unleash an onslaught that would shatter the Empire.

His return from exile sent shockwaves throughout the Empire. Wolfgard's brutal assault on General Horatio's fortress forced its loyal guardians into retreat. Yet, the cunning wolf would not reign victorious for long. Horatio regrouped and led the armies of the Empire's mighty lords and ladies against the bandit army, forcing the wolfish traitor to retreat once more. But even in defeat, Wolfgard's threats hung heavy in the air: &quot;Don't cherish your victory, Horatio! You have not seen the last of me! You and your rotten Empire will be ground down to dust!&quot;

The Empire celebrated the wolf's defeat, yet amidst the cheers and jubilation, Horatio and the lords and ladies of the realm remained wary. Wolfgard's ominous threats still echoed in their ears. The Empire must remain vigilant and united against this relentless predator.

For the cunning wolf bides his time until his victim shows signs of weakness… and then pounces!"/>

		<text id="generals_characters_109_name" name="Ushkal, the Thunder of the Steppes"/>
		<text id="generals_characters_109_narrative" name="“Hide in your fortresses, cower behind your walls. But know this, you are merely a small creature atop a high tree, trembling as the tide sweeps away all beneath. We are that flood, and like water, no force can hold us back!”

From the mysterious lands beyond the Fire Peaks, from plains unseen and untamed, comes the formidable figure of Ushkal. The loyal general of the Great Khan leads the nomadic hordes through the continent, their horses hooves like thunder, their determination as unyielding as the mountains themselves.

The nomads under Ushkal's command are as restless as the winds that sweep across their unseen homeland. They recognize no borders, no confines of kingdoms and empires, only the endless expanse of the world that stretches before them. They are creatures of freedom and fierce independence, taking what they need and going where they please. Their paths are drawn not by the lines of maps, but by the allure of the horizon and the beckoning of the unknown.

A titan among warriors, the  formidable nomad general is a sight to behold. His favored weapons, a swift scimitar and sturdy round shield, are handled with strength and grace, relentless and unstoppable like a stampeding herd. Yet, Ushkal is no mere brute. His strength is matched by a sharp strategic mind, skilled in the arts of both offense and defense. His warriors are experts of the charge and the flanking attack, striking with the ferocity of a sandstorm. The camps they establish are akin to fortresses, heavily defended and fiercely protected, a testament to Ushkal's understanding of a well-rounded defense.
For all his martial prowess, Ushkal is also a man of honor. Diplomats are treated with respect, and guests are greeted like kings, welcomed to partake in the nomads' feasts with bowls of fermented mare's milk and plates of juicy yak roast. His adversaries, including Lord Horatio, have found no fault in his hospitality, nor in his honor, even amid the trials of conflict. In fact, it is said that some of the Empire's finest pieces of art have been inspired by the nomads' intricate craftsmanship, their creations admired and prized throughout the land. And what stone-hearted knight or lady would not be moved to tears by the tragic and epic throat-singer ballad, “Flight of the nomad princess”.

But make no mistake, behind the honor and the feasts, the nomads are warriors to their core. They traverse kingdoms as they please, taking what they want. Any opposition is met with the thundering charge of the horde, trampling all resistance under their might. The steppes are free, and so are they. And anyone attempting to curtail their freedom will feel the full fury of Ushkal, the Thunder of the Steppes."/>

		<text id="generals_characters_110_name" name="Akechi, the Iron Shogun"/>
		<text id="generals_characters_110_narrative" name="&quot;Warrior's path winds,
Beneath cherry blossoms' shade,
Honor's face is masked.&quot;

From the heart of the Sunrise Kingdoms, where cherry blossoms dance in the wind and the warrior code of Bushido is law, emerges a formidable figure: Akechi, the Iron Shogun. 
A man of sharp contrast, he appreciates the tranquility of bonsai trees and the artful expression of kabuki theater. Akechi appears refined, his words are elegant and subtly cruel, insults and mockery carefully veiled behind the veneer of politeness. Yet, behind this façade of cultured sophistication, resides an ambitious warlord whose understanding of Bushido has been twisted by a lust for power. To Akechi, the path of the warrior is one of ceaseless battle and conquest. His distorted beliefs have spurred on brutal Samurai invasions of neighbouring realms, justified by a deluded sense of honor and duty.

Akechi's presence is formidable, his tall frame radiating a potent mix of strength and speed. His strikes, like his words, are swift and powerful, the calculated precision of a man who claims to be honorable. Yet, when threatened, he is known to cast aside his principles, unafraid to resort to dishonorable acts if they serve his agenda or preserve his life.
His rivalry with the moderate General Takemura has been long-standing, a game of strategic maneuvering and power plays for the future and soul of the Sunrise Kingdoms. Less well-known but just as fierce are his games of Hanafuda with the honorable Oba-san. Despite all strategy and cunning, Akechi has yet to best the elder matriarch in this battle of wits and will.
Yet, it is Sasaki, the Ronin Warrior, who poses the greatest affront to him. Her decision to abandon the Sunrise Kingdoms in defiance of his rule is a wound to his pride that has yet to heal. Her victory over him in combat is a scar on his honor that stings with every remembered blow. Akechi is prepared to repay Sasaki tenfold. Harakiri will be too easy a death for the honorless traitor.
His aggression has not gone unanswered. His clashes with Toril and Horatio of the Great Empire were fierce, and his attempts to invade the Storm Islands were thwarted by the tenacious Alyssa. Despite his setbacks, Akechi is relentless, fueled by a grudge that runs deep and a determination that's frighteningly resilient.

Behind the curtain of politeness, in the silence of his bonsai garden, Akechi plots his next move. For him, the world is a stage, and he is both the actor and the director. Those who cross him best beware, for the Shogun's revenge is a play written in the ink of blood and tears. For Sasaki, his former protégé, he dreams of a fittingly tragic finale. For himself, he dreams that his name becomes a whisper of dread that lingers long after his armies have retreated.

&quot;An autumn leaf falls,
In the silence, steel whispers,
Betrayal's cost paid.&quot;"/>

		<text id="generals_characters_111_narrative" name="&quot;Fair turns foul, and foul turns fair / the foolish remain unaware / Soon, our nemesis despair / our rule they shan't forbear!”

Amidst the nobility of the Empire, a corrupt cabal casts a long, dark shadow. This is the sinister world of the Bloodcrows, led by the Twisted Matriarch, Baba Varjúka. A distorted reflection of the Empire’s nobility, she is a perverse parody of the grandeur and honor they embody, replacing these virtues with deceit and treachery.
Baba Varjúka may hold the appearance of a noblewoman, but the cruel glint in her eyes and the venom in her words reveal a nature far from honorable. She moves among her enemies with the grace of a highborn lady, her words dripping with veiled threats and hollow courtesies.She embodies deceit where others bear honor, treachery where others engage in noble combat. Every utterance from her lips carries the potential for betrayal, every seemingly innocent gesture a precursor to a lethal strike from the dagger hidden behind her back.
Her followers, the Bloodcrows, are the shadows within the Empire's nobility, a grim specter of its corruption and decadence. They are cunning predators lurking in the darkest forests and untamed mountains, emerging from the shadows whenever weakness is detected. They draw power from forbidden rituals and dark magic, twisting the essence of life itself to extend their influence and reach. The Bloodcrows are the bloodied talons that clutch at the Empire's heart, drawing strength from its lifeforce.
The rumors whisper of Baba Varjúka's blood magic, providing her with a semblance of eternal youth, though her countenance betrays the terrible cost of such sorcery. In battle, she is a cunning predator, preferring to flank her enemies, lay traps, and employ deceit over face-to-face combat. Only a foolish general would underestimate the cunning crow and her fanatical followers.
Old tales suggest that Baba Varjúka once had a hand in the upbringing of the young prince who would become the Emperor. Yet, Horatio, ever the protector even as a young squire, managed to sway the prince from her toxic influence and banished her from court. Since that day, Baba Varjúka has harbored a deep enmity for Horatio. Her animosity also extends to Leo, who has persistently hunted her followers through forests and mountains, and to Valenta, a priestess of the sun order who has led the charge against the spreading influence of the Bloodcrows.
Despite the terror she instills, and the dark power she wields, Baba Varjúka serves as a grim reminder. She symbolizes the price of unchecked ambition and the cost of dark desires. Her twisted visage, despite her claims of eternal youth, bears the scars of her vile magic. Yet she remains, a dark specter in the Empire's core, a reminder that even in the heart of civilization, the siren song of ambition can lead to darkness."/>

		<text id="generals_characters_112_narrative" name="From a dimension far removed from our comprehension, a formless shadow emerges beyond the veil of reality. Bathed in a pulsating purple light, a manifestation of an otherworldly threat materializes. These are the Strangers, mirror images of us, yet corrupted and disquieting. Their existence is a paradox. Leading these entities from a realm beyond the reach of our understanding is Nukh'raia, the Otherworldly Marauder.

Nukh'raia is a grotesque inversion of a general, a chilling corruption of the human form that disturbs as much as it frightens. Their presence causes the bravest of hearts to quiver, as though reality itself buckles and shivers under their cold, calculating gaze. The barbed weapon they swing, a warped echo of earthly arms, slices the air with a precision that’s bone-chillingly mechanical. Each swing is a harbinger of terror and despair. Survivors of encounters with Nukh'raia whisper tales of a being as cold as the deepest winter and as merciless as the decay of time. No sound escapes from the Stranger’s General, no emotion betrays their mask-like face. Silent and impassive, they command their swarm with an unspoken will that’s as absolute as it is terrifying.

Cold, efficient, relentless – the Strangers under Nukh'raia's command know no reason or negotiation. Their attacks on the Empire are executed with ruthless precision that’s soullessly mechanical. Borders of kingdoms, pleas of diplomats – all are meaningless in their icy gaze that sees only opportunities to dominate and to spread the insidious taint of the Otherworld. Their castles, suffused with an ominous purple light, stand not as testaments to grandeur, but as harbingers of a dread that taints the land. Every tower, every wall, is a macabre echo of human architecture, radiating an unnerving blend of familiarity and alienness.

Yet, despite the relentless horror that the Strangers represent, hope is not extinguished. The inexorable passage of time, an unyielding force in our realm, appears to be their sole adversary. After an onslaught, the Strangers are banished back to their enigmatic dimension, their sinister castles dissipating as if they were mere illusions. But the cold certainty of their return looms like a persistent nightmare. As long as Nukh'raia exists, peace is but a fleeting dream, a moment's respite in a reality forever stalked by the Otherworldly Marauder. Their objectives remain an enigma, their desires unknowable. Nukh'raia does not divulge their thoughts to mere mortals. And if they did… perhaps the truth might be more terrible than ignorance."/>

		<text id="generals_characters_113_narrative" name="“Let the roar of House Gerbrandt echo through the heart of Berimond!&quot;

In the war-torn realm of Berimond, a figure of regal bearing and unyielding resolve stands firm - Leopold III of House Gerbrandt. The sigil of the lion, etched in vibrant red, speaks of his fierce courage and the royal lineage he fervently claims to uphold. Whispers among his men speak of a savage lion's attack, its mark on Leopold’s face  a constant reminder of his battle-hardened past. His feline features and regal bearing mask a mind of both calculating ambition and finely controlled rage.

Masterful in his approach to warfare, Leopold exercises a lion's patience, preferring strategic maneuvers to brute force. Yet, when stirred to anger, he strikes with the ferocity of his house's sigil, leaving foes quivering in the wake of his wrath. The battlefield reverberates with Leopold's maxim, &quot;In the heart of a lion, patience fuels the fire. We bide our time, yet when we strike, our roar echoes and our power is felt.&quot;

Leopold’s disdain for his rival, Grimbert of Ursidae, runs as deep as the history of Berimond itself. He views Grimbert as nothing more than an uncouth upstart, a blemish on the noble face of Berimond, as well as a personal annoyance. Citizens and nobles alike report having seen the rivals brawl and duel, even in the streets of the imperial capital. Yet rumors persist of the two kings occasionally being spotted together at a tavern’s most hidden table, covered in bruises yet sharing a drink like old comrades. One might wonder to what degree our rivalries inspire us … Of course, both kings proclaim these rumors as mere vile slander.

 Yet, Leopold's commitment to tradition and his unyielding belief in his birthright fuels his fiery resolve to preserve Berimond's past glory against Grimbert's ambition for change. Leopold III stands as a beacon of the old world, a staunch defender of his kingdom's proud lineage. The Lion of Berimond waits, watches, and when the moment comes, he strikes with the full fury of his namesake.

P.S.: &quot;If Grimbert put as much time and effort into ruling as he does to seeing the bottom of a beer barrel, perhaps Berimond wouldn't be in such disarray!&quot;"/>

		<text id="generals_characters_114_narrative" name="&quot;Let the strength of Ursidae surge through the veins of Berimond!&quot;

Amid the strife and chaos of Berimond, a warrior of raw power and unparalleled vigor stands against the tides of war - Grimbert of House Ursidae. The sigil of the bear, rendered in striking blue, encapsulates his indomitable strength and the daring nobility he earned through blood and valor. Grimbert, with his burly form, flaming red hair and rough features, is often mistaken as a mere brute, yet beneath this facade lies a cunning mind capable of surprising the most adept of tacticians.

Renowned for his direct and relentless approach to warfare, Grimbert believes in a show of power to crush his enemy's will. His thundering charge on the battlefield is likened to a bear's ferocious attack, eliciting both dread and respect from allies and adversaries alike. Grimbert's war doctrine resonates across the battlefields of Berimond, &quot;In the heart of a bear, strength and valor make their home. We do not wait - we act. Our roar resounds and our strength is undeniable.&quot;

His rivalry with Leopold III of House Gerbrandt is legendary. Grimbert perceives Leopold as a snobbish and over-refined aristocrat, whose claim of rulership only stems from the name of his ancestors instead of his own deeds. Berimond needs direct and decisive rulership, not flowery words and empty pomp! Tales of their clashes resonate across the realm, their bitter disputes often unfolding in the most unexpected of places - from the heart of Berimond’s battlefield to the green meadows of the Great Empire, and even to the cobbled streets of the imperial capital itself! Yet whispers also speak of rare nights where the two kings, battered and bruised, share a drink in the dim light of a secluded tavern like old comrades. One might wonder to what degree our rivalries inspire us … Of course, both kings proclaim these rumors as nothing more than vile slander.


Unbound by the chains of tradition, Grimbert carries an unyielding belief in the potential of Berimond. He envisions a kingdom reborn in the glory of the present, discarding the shackles of the past.

The Bear of Berimond charges ahead, unyielding, and when the moment is right, he seizes victory with a might akin to his namesake.

P.S.: &quot;Perhaps if Leopold spent less time grooming his mane and more on the battlefield, he might pose a real challenge!&quot;"/>

		<text id="generals_characters_115_narrative" name="&quot;Many names, many faces, but one dark purpose – greed knows no bounds.&quot;

As one navigates through the rugged landscapes of the Great Empire, scattered castles and towers dot the terrain, their menacing silhouettes stark against the skyline. Not the bastions of justice, but fortresses of fear, these are the domains of the Robber Barons.
Whether cloaked in the darkness of the woods, nestled in mountain crags, or lurking in the foggy marshes, the Robber Barons command from their ill-gotten keeps, their eyes always hungry for the wealth and lands of others.

Names like Bolko, Gamareth, and Karasek have been whispered among the subjects of the Empire, each name bringing with it a chill of dread. But the name matters not, for the purpose is singular: to plunder, to seize, to dominate.

Many of these opportunistic warlords flocked to Wolfgard the Flayer's banner during his reign of terror, finding in him a kindred spirit of ruthless ambition. And even after Wolfgard's fall, the remnants of his dark legion continue their vile deeds, now under the banner of the Robber Baron General.

The Robber Barons remain a constant, unyielding threat to the prosperity of the Great Empire. Yet, the Empire's loyal subjects and brave lords and ladies stand firm. They refuse to bow to the lawless plunderers. Their courage and valor serve as a beacon of hope against the endless tide of the Robber Barons. For they know that unity is their strength, and determination their shield.

The Robber Barons may represent the cruel and relentless force of the Barons, but the Great Empire holds stalwart heroes of its own, ever ready to meet the challenge, ever willing to protect their realm."/>

		<text id="generals_characters_118_narrative" name="&quot;They call this place a wasteland, but it's merely the crucible from which the future will be forged.&quot;
To the east of the Great Empire, the landscape drastically transforms. Mighty volcanoes dominate the horizon, their fiery hearts spewing grey ash and streams of lava. Dominating this harsh landscape are the mighty towers and fortresses of the dragon cult, guarded by the fiery beasts themselves, their dark and forbidding magic controlling these dreadful creatures of legend. Amidst these volatile lands, one woman rules with ruthless certainty: Yigris, Lady of the Flames.
As lean as the dagger she wields with deadly precision, Yigris's quick wit and biting mockery can sting as much as her poisons. Her razor-sharp grin is a constant reminder of her capacity for cruelty, a testament to her unwavering commitment to uphold the cult's ruthless rule. She is a woman of great ambition, not content to dominate only her volcanic realm. Yigris has grander plans. She seeks to undermine the Great Empire, to rot it from within, to bring it to its knees.
A bitter betrayal marked Yigris rise to power. She and her cousin Toril were raised to be the cult's leaders. But where Toril chose to escape the cruelties of the cult, Yigris betrayed her cousin and stabbed her with a poisoned blade. While Toril escaped with her life intact, Yigris rose to rule the cult unopposed.
A lean woman with short hair and a face as sharp as a razor blade, Yigris rules with a wicked grin and a dagger as quick as her tongue. Her barbed humor is as lethal as the poisons she expertly crafts. Unafraid to employ dark and forbidden magics, she wields her power with deadly precision, aiming to undermine the Empire and corrode its foundations.
Despite her power and the terror she spreads, Yigris has made enemies of her own. Her cousin Toril, now a fierce warrior of the Empire, seeks vengeance for Yigris's betrayal and strives to end the cruel reign of fire. Their conflict is personal, a clash of blood turned bitter. The ronin warrior Sasaki, ambushed by the cultists during her journey from the Sunrise Kingdoms to the Great Empire, remains another potent adversary.

In the desolate reaches of the Fire Peaks, under the brooding gaze of dragons and the watchful eyes of her cult, Yigris plots. She will stop at nothing to ensure the fall of the Empire, to watch it crumble and burn, just like the lands she so proudly commands. As the Lady of the Flames, Yigris is a force to be reckoned with. Those who dare to challenge her better learn from Toril’s mistake… and watch their back…"/>

SHADOW UNITS
The shady shadow mercenaries are roaming the land in search of some unscrupulous work. They will fight your enemies discreetly, given ample payment. Keep an eye out for their arrival.

EASY CONSTRUCTION 
Handling buildings and decorative items in the castle has been improved. Press down on an object and you will be taken straight to the castle’s building mode.

NEW LANGUAGES 
From now on you can also play Empire: Four Kingdoms in Japanese and Greek. To do so, change the language in the game’s settings.

		<text id="ingameHelp_category_11_text_1" name="Units &amp; tools are intended for &lt;12attacking and looting&lt; as well as for the &lt;13defense&lt; of your castle.

What unit types are there?
Each unit is ideally suited for a particular role, either attacking or defending. A distinction is also made between melee and ranged units.

How can you recruit units?
Units are recruited at the &lt;4barracks&lt;. To recruit units, you will need &lt;6coins&lt;.

Always make sure that you have plenty of food to feed your troops! Units consume &lt;5food&lt; regularly, and will starve as soon as your supply has been depleted. If you own a military hospital, some of your fallen or starved units can be healed there. 

Keep an eye on your military hospital's capacity as once it is full, units who have fallen or starved will be lost!

Shadow mercenaries are a special type of unit who come to your castle to offer their services from time to time. They don't consume any of your castle's food supplies, and the &lt;13defender&lt; will not discover who hired them.

Tools
The different types of tools are used for various purposes and in different areas in &lt;12attacks&lt; and for &lt;13defense&lt;.

Siege tools can be used when &lt;12attacking&lt; an enemy castle, for example to reduce the defender's &lt;13wall or castle gate protection&lt;. You can assign defense tools to your castle walls or your castle gate to weaken enemy attacks.

How can you make tools?
Tools are produced in two &lt;4military buildings&lt;: the defense workshop and the siege workshop. To produce tools, you need &lt;5resources&lt; or &lt;7rubies&lt;.

Attack and defense tools can only be used once in battle.

When an outpost, village, or monument has been captured by an enemy player, all unassigned tools in the location will be returned to the previous owner’s tool storage in their main castle."/>

Agents allow you to spy on enemies before an &lt;12attack&lt; to discover their &lt;13defense&lt; (military espionage) or &lt;5resources&lt; (economic espionage).

To spy on a &lt;14robber baron castle&lt; or another lord's castle, tap on the enemy castle icon in the &lt;10world map&lt; and select espionage from the ring menu.

The travel costs for espionage depend on the distance to be traveled on the &lt;10world map&lt;, the number of agents deployed, and the mission risk.

How can you protect yourself from enemy agents?
City guards increase the risk for enemy agents. The number of city guards you have depends on the number and level of your guardhouses.

- glass: produced in glass furnaces in the Fire Peaks
- iron ore: produced in iron mines in the Great Empire

The locations of your production buildings within your castle have no effect on their production.

In addition, you can exchange and trade resources with other castle lords. Your trade partner needs to unlock these resources first. They don't need to have a castle in the same kingdom. They only need to have the appropriate experience level.

Certain pending rewards contain locked additional rewards, which can be unlocked by purchasing a reward pass. Once unlocked they will be added to your inventory when you select to collect the rewards from a notification.

Use the manage pending rewards function to quickly collect or unlock all your pending rewards.

		<text id="help_difficultyScaling" name="The difficulty selection overview allows players to select a difficulty level for the upcoming invasion event. The difficulty you select for the event will not only determine the strength of the invading targets, but also the quality of rewards you can win during the event. Keep in mind this applies to the alliance activity rewards as well; you and your alliance mates will still contribute together for the alliance scoring, but might receive different individual rewards.

You can access the difficulty selection overview at the start of each event by visiting the relevant event camp outside your castle, or by directly interacting with an invading target on the world map. Please note that you can't attack or spy on event targets until a difficulty level has been chosen. 

Once a difficulty level has been selected, it can't be changed until the start of the next event, so be sure to take your time with your selection! 

It is also possible to play the event in classic mode, with no difficulty level selected. In this scenario, the standard pool of rewards will be available to win. 

Higher difficulty levels need to be unlocked, which can be done by earning achievements related to the event. For example, to unlock the &quot;hard&quot; difficulty level, you must first defeat a certain number of invading camps while playing on the intermediate + level. You can also temporarily unlock difficulty levels for active events with rubies. Please note that difficulty levels unlocked with rubies will only remain unlocked for the duration of the current event only."/>

You can place the soldiers and tools in the slots yourself, or you can choose the autofill option to have the current attack wave filled for you automatically.

Autofill uses the espionage report about your target to determine how to best fill the attack wave. The more accurate the report is, the better your warriors and tools will be positioned to defeat the enemy. If there is no espionage report, a balance of units and tools will be chosen. Autofill will always try to achieve the highest possible attack power so that you suffer as few losses as possible. The number of tools used and how they are distributed will be determined according to the defensive bonuses from the defender's castle gate and castle wall. Autofill takes into consideration your commander's equipment effects as well.

Please keep in mind that bonuses that affect travel speed are not effective during capture attacks.

An automatically filled attack wave can be changed at any time by adding or removing units or tools manually.

When attack support tools have been unlocked, they can be used to add additional effects to an attack. Support tools always apply to the entire battle, not a specific front/flank or wave of the attack."/>
